# WCGAN-GP-Quasi-2D colloidal image generator
The Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty, abbreviated as WCGAN-GP, is a model developed by  [Walia, Tierney and McKeever 2020](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347437993_Synthesising_Tabular_Data_using_Wasserstein_Conditional_GANs_with_Gradient_Penalty_WCGAN-GP)   for data generation. The WCGAN-GP uses the Wasserstein loss along with the gradient penalty. This approach contributes to greater stability during training. In addition, it stands out for being a conditional GAN, which implies its ability to generate conditional data according to the input label.

In this repository you will find 3 scripts. The first is the WCGAN-GP and exemplifies its application by generating synthetic data from a specific data set (Images obtained through bright field video microscopy). It is worth noting that, in this context, WCGAN-GP has been adapted to generate statistically equivalent quasi-2D colloidal images. 
. The second is called tracking.py and is used to track particles. The last file graph_g(r) is used to calculate the radial distribution function (rdf) known as g(r). This is a metric that is used to compare the images generated by the WCGAN-GP and the experimental images.

## Run 
Note that the code was executed in Google Colab and the images with which it was trained are located on a drive. Once the images are loaded, they have a dimension of 600x600 pixels. We execute the function "check_generator" when executing this function it will generate an image like the following:

![example](https://github.com/victorhugo1733/WCGAN-GP-Quasi-2D-colloidal-image-generator/blob/main/Generated%20images/noise_image_Iteration_0.png)

Then we establish the number of times we need and wait for the script to compile. After this, we can run the "interpolate_class" function to interpolate between the classes. defining the classes in "start_class" and "end_class" the allowed values are 0,1,2,3 and 4 where 0 corresponds to the area fraction of 0.05, 1 corresponds to the area fraction of 0.15 and successively up to the number 4 which corresponds to the area fraction 0.45. In the special case where "start_class" and "end_class" are set to the same value, no interpolation will be performed, the function will only generate new images of the selected concentration as in the following example:

Finally you can use the last lines of the code to generate images of the concentrations you want, whether they are interpolated images or not. The following image was generated with WCGAN-GP for an area fraction of 0.45

## Load the Model
Once the model is trained we use the command “model.save_weights” it is a function that is used to save the weights of a neural network model in a file. Saving the model can help save the progress of a training model so that training can be resumed at a later date without having to start from scratch. To do this, you also need to save the discriminator and the generator. The “discriminator.save” command saves the discriminator architecture to a file. The “generator.save” command is used to save the generator architecture to a file. These commands can be useful for sharing models with other users or for using a trained model in different applications.
Once the file is saved, it can be loaded again using the “model.load$\_$weights” and “load$\_$model” commands. The first command loads the weights of a neural network model and the second command is used to load the generator and discriminator.
